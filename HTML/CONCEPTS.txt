In this section, we worked with different concepts of html, using html 5 and understanding the notation and tags by the language.
We see different kinds of tags as:
-> <title></title> To define the title in the web side
-> <p></p> To define paragraphs
-> <hr> To create horizontal lines
-> <a href="http://"></a> To create links between pages
-> <br> To jump lines
-> <table></table> To define tables
-> <th></th> That are the table headers
-> <video></video> To multimedia content
-> <iframe></iframe> To insert code by other page

And we builded a simple form app with login, sign-in and a home page
